# firebegetsfire
Code used to analyze reburn events in western US forests. Code supports Nathan Korinek's masters thesis alongside his paper submission: Does Fire Beget Fire: An Investigation of Firesâ€™ Influence on Future Fire Severity in Western US Forests

If you want to recreate this workflow, you will have to run the scripts in the following order:
1. `create_annual_cbi.py`
2. `get_cbi_values.py`
3. `create_cbi_overlay.py`
4. `fireseverity_compare.ipynb`

The CBI dataset is soon to be published but inaccessible as of now.
